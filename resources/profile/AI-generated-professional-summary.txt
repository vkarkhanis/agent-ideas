I am a Senior Technology Leader with over two decades of experience transforming engineering organizations across financial services, investment management, and fintech. My career has been defined by architecting large-scale platforms, modernizing legacy systems, and building high-performance global teams that deliver consistently at enterprise scale.

Over the past several years, I have played a pivotal role at ClearWater Analytics (formerly Enfusion), where I established and scaled India’s web and mobile engineering capability from the ground up. This transformation elevated India from a small extension team to a strategic product development hub, now responsible for over 80% of global delivery. As an Executive Director and India Product Lead, I shape regional technology strategy across Mumbai, Noida, and Bengaluru, define engineering governance, mentor senior managers into strategic leaders, and represent India’s development organization at a global level.

I work closely with US leadership on product strategy, architectural planning, and long-term modernization initiatives. A key part of my role includes architecting the next-generation web and mobile platform leveraging OpenFin, React, React Native, Java/Spring Boot, and cloud-ready principles—with a multi-year roadmap aimed at fully transitioning from desktop to modern web ecosystems. My leadership spans team building, talent strategy, cross-site delivery orchestration, stakeholder alignment, and global program execution.

Before ClearWater/Enfusion, I spent a decade in leadership roles at Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, developing and modernizing mission-critical trading, order management, and market risk systems. I led the architectural redesign of batch-oriented platforms into high-performance event-driven systems, enhanced real-time risk visibility, and built front-office web trading components using React integrated with ultra-low-latency backends like AMPS. At both firms, I was trusted to build teams from scratch, drive complex multi-stakeholder transformations, and operate at the intersection of technology execution and business outcomes. I was promoted to Vice President at both Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan for my impact.

My career foundation was built at MSCI, where I led the development of data-intensive platforms such as TrueCoverage and HealthQA, while also heading the Java Centre of Excellence. At TCS, I supported clients such as Bank of America, GE, Chrysler Financial, and Ascent Media, gaining early exposure to enterprise delivery, product integrations, and stakeholder management—including a 19-month stint in the United States where I independently owned the integration of a third-party content management system for Chrysler Financial’s eContract platform.

Across 20+ years, I have consistently taken on roles that expand my scope—moving from developer to architect, from team lead to systems owner, and ultimately from project manager to global technology leader overseeing multi-region engineering organizations. Each transition has strengthened my expertise across domains, business models, operating cultures, and technology ecosystems.

Technically, I remain hands-on and deeply grounded in modern engineering. My experience spans Java (JDK 4–21), Spring Boot, React, React Native, TypeScript, SQL/NoSQL databases, microservices, event-driven systems, messaging, OpenFin, CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes. I am an early mover in exploring AI adoption across web/mobile teams—identifying opportunities to improve developer productivity, code quality, and client experience through intelligent automation.

Beyond professional work, I enjoy engineering side-projects, teaching complex concepts through simplified learning models, playing the guitar, and exploring new technologies. I maintain active GitHub and Bitbucket repositories and have previously developed a mobile app on Android. I also have a strong interest in building educational technology products, including AI-driven competitive exam preparation tools and real-time market data simulators.

As a leader, I value clarity, accountability, resilience, and people-centric growth. I believe in creating teams that feel they work with you, not for you. My long-term aspiration is to continue operating at a global leadership level—driving architectural strategy, scaling engineering capability across geographies, accelerating digital transformation, and shaping organizations into world-class technology hubs.

I would also love to work as consultant in engagements where my professional experience is put to proper use and help client drive their initiatives.
