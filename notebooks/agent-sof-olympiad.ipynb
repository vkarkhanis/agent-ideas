      "\n",
      "**Summary:** This is an excellent set of practice questions. They are well-aligned with the SOF IMO Level 1 syllabus and style, covering a good range of topics with appropriate difficulty. The questions effectively test logical reasoning, conceptual understanding, and application skills. A few minor tweaks could make the set even stronger.\n",

      "### **Question-by-Question Breakdown**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **1. Logical Reasoning (Direction Sense)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 9/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A classic and perfectly age-appropriate direction sense problem. It requires students to visualize the path without a diagram, which is a key skill tested in the Logical Reasoning section. The final direction (Southeast) is a correct and non-trivial answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Number Sense (Place Value)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 10/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** This is an outstanding question. It cleverly goes beyond a simple place value check by using numbers that require regrouping (12 tens = 120, 15 ones = 15). Students must understand that 12 tens is not just \"2 in the tens place.\" It perfectly tests deep number sense. **835** is the correct, non-obvious answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Patterns (Number Series)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 8/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A very good pattern question. The sequence (adding 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...) is a common IMO pattern that tests a student's ability to identify the pattern of odd numbers. The next number, **37**, is correct. The difficulty is just right for Grade 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Geometry (Counting Figures)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 7/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** The concept is excellent and very common in IMO. The rating is lower *only because the figure is described in text*. In an actual exam, a diagram is provided. The description \"a large triangle divided into 4 smaller triangles by lines from each vertex to the center\" is generally clear, but could be interpreted as creating only 4 triangles. A skilled student will realize that the central area also forms triangles with the vertices, leading to the correct answer of **8** (1 large, 4 medium, 3 small?)/or more depending on the exact figure. Since the options only go up to 7, it's likely the intended answer is **5** (4 small + 1 large). The ambiguity in the textual description is the only weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **5. Word Problem (Fractions)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 9/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A standard and well-framed word problem on fractions. It requires a two-step process: first find 3/5 of 125, then subtract from the total. The numbers are manageable, and the correct answer is **50**. This is a high-quality question.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **6. Fractions (Comparison)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 10/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A fundamental and crucial question for this level. To find the largest fraction, students cannot simply compare numerators and denominators.

      "**Summary:** This is an excellent set of practice questions. They are well-aligned with the SOF IMO Level 1 syllabus and style, covering a good range of topics with appropriate difficulty. The questions effectively test logical reasoning, conceptual understanding, and application skills. A few minor tweaks could make the set even stronger.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### **1. Logical Reasoning (Direction Sense)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 9/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A classic and perfectly age-appropriate direction sense problem. It requires students to visualize the path without a diagram, which is a key skill tested in the Logical Reasoning section. The final direction (Southeast) is a correct and non-trivial answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Number Sense (Place Value)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 10/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** This is an outstanding question. It cleverly goes beyond a simple place value check by using numbers that require regrouping (12 tens = 120, 15 ones = 15). Students must understand that 12 tens is not just \"2 in the tens place.\" It perfectly tests deep number sense. **835** is the correct, non-obvious answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Patterns (Number Series)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 8/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A very good pattern question. The sequence (adding 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...) is a common IMO pattern that tests a student's ability to identify the pattern of odd numbers. The next number, **37**, is correct. The difficulty is just right for Grade 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Geometry (Counting Figures)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 7/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** The concept is excellent and very common in IMO. The rating is lower *only because the figure is described in text*. In an actual exam, a diagram is provided. The description \"a large triangle divided into 4 smaller triangles by lines from each vertex to the center\" is generally clear, but could be interpreted as creating only 4 triangles. A skilled student will realize that the central area also forms triangles with the vertices, leading to the correct answer of **8** (1 large, 4 medium, 3 small?)/or more depending on the exact figure. Since the options only go up to 7, it's likely the intended answer is **5** (4 small + 1 large). The ambiguity in the textual description is the only weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **5. Word Problem (Fractions)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 9/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A standard and well-framed word problem on fractions. It requires a two-step process: first find 3/5 of 125, then subtract from the total. The numbers are manageable, and the correct answer is **50**. This is a high-quality question.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **6. Fractions (Comparison)**\n",
      "*   **Rating:** 10/10\n",
      "*   **Evaluation:** A fundamental and crucial question for this level. To find the largest fraction, students cannot simply compare numerators and denominators.
